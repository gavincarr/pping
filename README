Introduction
============

pping is a parallel-ping utility for sending multiple ICMP echo requests
to sets of target hosts. It produces a line of output every second
reporting colour-coded round-trip-times for every host.

See 'perldoc pping' for more documentation (or the man page if using the
rpm version).


Prerequisites
=============

pping is written in perl and requires the following perl modules:

- POE
- POE::Component::Client::Ping
- Term::Size::Unix
- Config::Tiny
- Term::ANSIColor (from the 'ANSIColor' package)
- Getopt::Std
- File::Basename
- File::Spec

With reasonably modern perls the last four are typically included with
perl itself.



Installation
============

Copy 'pping' to somewhere in your path. 

If you want a man page you can do something like:

  pod2man --section=8 -r pping pping > /usr/share/man/man8/pping.8

as root or via sudo (or just put it somewhere you have permissions and 
add to your MANPATH).



Licence
=======

pping is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (see
the COPYING file).
